### Archived
This repository is now archived as there is a newer version of this available.
Please refer to the following two repositories instead:
* [ak!ra](https://github.com/kyaulabs/akira): botpack for hybrid(core)
* [hybrid(core)](https://github.com/kyaulabs/hybridcore): A security patch for eggdrop based on the eggdrop1.1.6 hybrid(core) patch

### About
This botnet script has been around for longer than I can remember. While I know
the original author was German, past this I know nothing (the script in its
original form was given to me by a friend long ago). It has had three major
iterations since, evolving originally from a clone of netbots that I called
`tribe9`, these two scripts were merged together to form `blackmajick` which
also gained a few external module scripts and channel limit control (imported
from a script called dolimit) along with a BitchX clone mode (makes the eggdrop
appear as if it is a BitchX client). Around 2006 I started getting back into TCL
coding and IRC in general and modified the script quite a bit, only to once
again rename the script to `darkMAGE`.

### Usage
In order to use this script with your botnet, add the script to your eggdrop config
and restart/rehash your eggdrop. Linking bots is relatively easy.

```shell
"On the HUB"
> .+bot leafbot 1.2.3.4 +9900/9901
> .+host leafbot *!ident@1.2.3.4
> .+host leafbot *!ident@hostname
> .chattr leafbot +bfopA
> .botattr leafbot +gs
```

```shell
"On Each Connecting Bot"
> .+bot hub 1.2.3.4 +9900/9901
> .+host hub *!ident@1.2.3.4
> .+host hub *!ident@hostname
> .chattr hub +bfopA
> .botattr hub +ghp
```

Keep in mind the `A` flag is set by default as the "control all bots" flag. Also do not forget to change the value of `bop_opkey`.
